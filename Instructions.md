## Practical Task

Create a ticket on the board for the task described below, estimate it after you reviewed the requirements.

- Implement a Docker Compose manifest, which creates a container with the database. Override default username and password with the custom ones.
- Pass sensitive (password, etc) and configurable (username, port, etc) variables using `.env` file.
- Configure Docker volume to keep the data in case of container re-creation.
- Run Docker Compose for the previously created manifest.
- Make sure that the container is running and you can connect to it using `localhost`. For example, using **DBeaver**.
- Extend the `README` file of your submodule mentioning instructions on how to use the manifest to create a local database. Make sure the instructions are **clear, functional, and reproducible**.
- Capture the acquired knowledge in a markdown file and discuss it with the mentor.

Create a **Merge Request**, which adds a **Docker Compose manifest** to the repository and instructions to the `README` file on how to use it. Make sure the instructions are **clear, functional, and reproducible**.
